# GeoGoal
The text reminder app triggered by your favorite or not so favorite haunts.

GeoGoal is a reminder app that triggers an SMS message reminder when you come close to a location of your choosing. The reminders can be set to tell you to go to the gym, pick up milk from the grocery store, or stay away from a bar you've been frequenting too often. All messages are personalized by you so you can use the words you find most motivating. Reminders can be recurring or one-time messages sent based on your calendar.
